<h1 class="subtitle">I. ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Employed inventors generally reserve no intellectual property rights and
very limited monetary rights for themselves when they assign their patents to their
employers. Applying the theoretical framework known as Therapeutic
Jurisprudence, this study contemplates the possibility of greater employee
productivity through the satisfaction of their self-interest and thus, of national
economic development by stimulating innovation. By conducting a qualitative
analysis of the responses of ten inventors to a web-based, mostly open-ended
questionnaire, we were able to explore therapeutic alternatives to this one-sided
patent scheme. Results show that inventors desire monetary compensation based
on employer’s patent related revenue wish to reserve some rights that might be
construed as moral rights for themselves, and find apologies and public admissions
to be significant remedies in patent related conflicts. The results of this study are
important to practitioners and legislators alike, as it recommends solutions on a
private and public level.</p>

<h1 class="subtitle">II. INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>At the time of writing, since the first application was filed in 1974, there
have been 354 applications and 353 issued patents where the assignee’s state is
Puerto Rico.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Why would a country with nearly four million inhabitants have less than 500 issued patents and patent applications, when states similar in size have at
least thousands?<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Patents have regularly been used as indicators of innovation across
scholarly literature.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> Behind every patent are its inventors, the brains behind the
product. Since the independent inventor is nowadays a rarity, most inventors
currently fall within two categories of employees: the employee that was “hired to
invent,” whose inventions resulting from his employment are assigned to the
employer; or the employee that was not hired to invent, but uses his employer’s
resources to do so, where the employer only has a “shop right” license and the
invention remains assigned to the employee. Patent law requires the employee’s
assignment to be made in writing, something that is extremely different from
copyright law. In fact, some commentators consider that patent law should borrow
from copyright law and adopt an “inventions made for hire” doctrine, which does
not require a written assignment if an employment contract exists.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>What do inventors think of the existing legal landscape? Do they think it’s
fair? What alternatives, if any, do they propose in lieu of full rights assignment in the
case of being hired to invent? What remedies do they think are appropriate if
infringement occurs? Do they consider apologies appropriate remedies? This article
provides possible answers to these questions by examining a group of inventors’
perceptions and attitudes towards the U.S. patent system. Perhaps, through a more
therapeutic approach to managing patent right assignment, employed inventors
would be more satisfied in their workplaces, fostering innovation and economic
development. </p>

<h1 class="subtitle">III. CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Innovation is essential for economic development. Young economies with
colonial baggage, most notably India in this century, have focused their
developmental efforts in fostering a generation of technological capital. Research
and development in these disarticulated economies<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> result in the export of
intellectual wealth. Puerto Rico is not an exception; with less than 500 lifetime
patents, there must be a lot of innovation that is not being commercialized.
</p>
<p>The employed inventor has spoken: compensation based on employer’s
patent related revenue, reservation of some rights that might be construed as moral
rights, and apologies and public admissions are therapeutic alternatives to our
flawed patent system that forgets that without inventors, there are no inventions.
Law reform is necessary and this multi-disciplinary process is nothing, if not
challenging. As L. Michael Hager eloquently says:<p>
<p>If law reform is a prerequisite for development, a corollary is the need for
lawyers to lead that reform. More than legal craftsmanship is required for effective
lawmaking, for the paths of development law are largely unchartered.
Moreover, tinkering with one part of the legal system demands comprehension of
the whole. Lawyers, by training and instinct, consider the procedural implications of
substantive changes. Legal policy making is a distinct art, notwithstanding its
dependence upon economics, political science, and sociology in development
matters.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup></p></p>
